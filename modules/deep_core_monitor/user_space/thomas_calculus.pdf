  THOMAS' CALCULUS - 14th Edition
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  The Anchor Object

  Unit-02's most precious possession. Not for the math.
  For the person who gave it to them.

  File Metadata:
  - Owner: Unit-02 (Thomas Chen)
  - Last Accessed: Every single day for 10 years
  - Wear Level: 89% (heavily used, well-loved)
  - Emotional Significance: MAXIMUM

  Notes in margins written by Thomas's father:
  - "You'll use this in college, son. I believe in you."
  - "Derivatives measure change. You're changing every day."
  - "Remember: dx/dt is just 'how fast you're growing.'"

  Blood stains on page 247 (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus):
  - From paper cut, age 16
  - Never cleaned. Kept as reminder of late-night study sessions.

  Coffee ring on page 412 (Infinite Series):
  - From all-nighter before final exam
  - Thomas passed. Father was proud.

  Bookmark at page 891 (Multivariable Integration):
  - Stuck there since father died
  - Thomas couldn't bring himself to move forward

  This is not a textbook.
  This is a connection to a dead parent.
  This is proof that someone believed in him.

  When Unit-01 asked for something that matters,
  Unit-02 hesitated for 17 minutes,
  then uploaded this.

  Not because it's valuable.
  Because it's *everything*.
