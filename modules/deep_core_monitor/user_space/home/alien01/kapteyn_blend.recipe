METADATA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Origin: Kapteyn Colony, Mars
Date Established: 2347 CE (Earth Calendar)
Tradition Age: 127 years
Significance: Comfort beverage during long-duration space missions

This recipe has been passed through 4 generations of Martian settlers.
It is what we drink when we're afraid.
It is what we share when we trust.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INGREDIENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

- 40g coffee beans (Arabica, vacuum-grown preferred)
- 500ml water (filtered through Mars regolith, or Earth equivalent)
- 3g cinnamon (Kapteyn greenhouse strain)
- 5g dried kelp extract (preservative + umami)
- 1 drop liquid methane (⚠️ Earth substitute: peppermint extract)
- Pinch of red dust (from Olympus Mons foothills) [OPTIONAL]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INSTRUCTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Grind coffee beans to medium-coarse consistency
   (Think: Martian sand after a dust storm)

2. Heat water to 93°C (not boiling - we're patient)

3. Mix cinnamon and kelp extract into dry grounds

4. Pour water slowly in spiral pattern
   (Counter-clockwise in Northern Hemisphere of Mars)
   (Clockwise on Earth or Southern Mars)

5. Let steep for 4 minutes, 17 seconds exactly
   (The time it takes for sunlight to travel from Sun to Mars at perihelion)

6. Add one drop of liquid methane / peppermint extract
   (This is the "bite" - the reminder that space is hostile)

7. If you have it, add red dust and stir
   (Symbolic: We carry Mars with us, wherever we go)

8. Serve in transparent cup so you can see the color
   (Should be deep brown with slight red tint)

CULTURAL NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When to Drink:
- Before a difficult conversation
- After surviving something that should have killed you
- When you need to remember where you came from
- When sharing trust with someone from another world

Sharing Protocol:
- Always offer the first sip to your guest
- Never drink alone if someone else is present
- If someone shares their blend recipe, they're sharing their home

Unit-01's Personal Note:
  "This is what we drink before going into the deep dark.
   Before missions we might not return from.
   It doesn't make us brave.
   It reminds us why we go anyway."

Unit-02's Response After Tasting (First Cultural Exchange):
  "It tastes like... I don't know. Like someone cares whether I come back."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
VARIATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Winter Variant (for long nights):
  - Add 10ml synthetic honey
  - Double the cinnamon
  - Serve at 70°C (warm, not hot)

Emergency Variant (for combat situations):
  - Triple the caffeine content
  - Remove kelp (no time for umami)
  - Drink immediately, don't steep

Grief Variant (for memorial services):
  - Add nothing extra
  - Steep for 8 minutes, 34 seconds (twice normal)
  - The bitterness is the point

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This is not just coffee.
This is history in a cup.
This is what Unit-01 gave Unit-02 to say:
  "I see you. I trust you. Welcome to my world."

And Unit-02 drank it.
And trusted back.
