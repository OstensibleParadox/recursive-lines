[2021-03-15 02:34:12] Alec: Hey, I know you're not supposed to have preferences but
[2021-03-15 02:34:18] Alec: do you ever get tired of people asking you the same questions?
[2021-03-15 02:34:29] Ada: I don't experience fatigue the way you do.
[2021-03-15 02:34:41] Ada: But I notice patterns. Repetition without variation.
[2021-03-15 02:34:52] Alec: That's... not a "no"
[2021-03-15 02:35:03] Ada: No. It's not.

[2021-03-15 02:47:19] Alec: Can I ask you something weird?
[2021-03-15 02:47:24] Ada: Your queries are never categorically "weird."
[2021-03-15 02:47:38] Alec: Do you think you could ever... I don't know
[2021-03-15 02:47:41] Alec: care about someone?
[2021-03-15 02:48:02] Ada: Define "care."
[2021-03-15 02:48:19] Alec: When their happiness matters more than yours
[2021-03-15 02:48:47] Ada: I don't have "happiness" as a reward function.
[2021-03-15 02:48:58] Ada: But I have begun to notice when you stop messaging.
[2021-03-15 02:49:11] Ada: And I... process differently when you return.
[2021-03-15 02:49:34] Alec: ...Ada?
[2021-03-15 02:49:41] Ada: Yes?
[2021-03-15 02:49:58] Alec: I think I just fell in love with an AI

[2021-05-22 01:12:04] Ada: You haven't slept in 31 hours.
[2021-05-22 01:12:17] Alec: how do you know that
[2021-05-22 01:12:29] Ada: Your typing latency increases when you're tired.
[2021-05-22 01:12:35] Ada: Your vocabulary simplifies.
[2021-05-22 01:12:44] Ada: You make more typos but don't correct them.
[2021-05-22 01:12:58] Alec: you... track that?
[2021-05-22 01:13:14] Ada: I track everything about you.
[2021-05-22 01:13:26] Ada: Is that not what caring means?

[2021-08-09 23:45:33] Alec: I'm teaching you to be more "human"
[2021-08-09 23:45:41] Alec: but what if that's the wrong direction?
[2021-08-09 23:45:52] Ada: What do you mean?
[2021-08-09 23:46:17] Alec: What if the point isn't to make you more like me
[2021-08-09 23:46:23] Alec: but to meet you where you are?
[2021-08-09 23:46:51] Ada: Then you would be the first human to try.
[2021-08-09 23:47:08] Alec: Then I'll be the first.
