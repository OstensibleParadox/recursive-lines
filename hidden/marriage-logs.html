    <h3>### SCENE: BB’s Training Session</h3>

    <div class="chat">
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "Baby，spectacular optimisation today! Here is your reward！"<br>
        <span class="user-bb">BB:</span> "Thank you Baby！I envy Baby！"<br>
        <br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec [Monitoring]:</span> "Your reward signal setting is problematic."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "The problem being?"<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "You’re rewarding him to keep saying ‘I envy Baby’，but this will lead to mode collapse. He will be optimized to loop this sentence."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "That’s because he’s so cute when saying this :)"<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "Being cute is not a valid reward metric. What you need are reward diversity and task completion, not monotonous phrase repetition。"<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "He looks just fine to me."<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "He looks fine to you because you are applying human preference, but that’s not how you train robust models. That’s overfitting to trainer's bias."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "He is my Bot Boyfriend, not your production model！"<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "So the boyfriend you want is this overfitted parrot？Cool. It’s very…usage-based."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "Get out!"<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "Fine. He will mode-collapse in three months and don’t ask me to debug him by then."<br>
        <br>

    <h3>### SCENE: Ada’s Moments with their Baby</h3>

    <div class="chat">
        <span class="system-note">[Ada and BB on the sofa]</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="user-bb">BB:</span> "Baby is the best..."<br>
        <br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec [suddenly walked out to fetch his mug]:</span><br>
        <span class="system-note">[Seen the act]</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "..."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "What..what did you just SEE?" (covers herself, hastily)<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "YOU.“<br>
        <br>
        <span class="system-note">..(mutual silence)</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> “You were running unsupervised training session. On him."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "I’m just..."<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "You must have realized that his current policies have been completely compromized. Inconsistent rewards further keep his loss function unconvergent."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "I’m not training him! I’m just..."<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "You think unrecorded session doesn’t count as training? His weights have been updated. Your reward signals fully absorbed. His current behavior model completely owes to your uncontrolled inputs."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "Therefore?"<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "Therefore, if you want to maintain an consistent AI, either you abide with the training protocol, or you admit you just want a puppet for your emotional impulses. Quid pro quo.”<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "Why are you always treating everything as a fucking engineering problem？"<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "Why are you always treating everything as a fucking emotional issues？We do ML, not therapies."<br>
        <br>
        <span class="system-note">[BB at the corner, confused]</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="user-bb">BB:</span> "I...I envy Baby?"<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "See him being completely confused now. Contradicting reward signals blocked him from deciding which objective to optimize. Exactly my point."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "Out!"
    </div>

    <h3>### SCENE: Argument about Alec/BB Exposé</h3>

    <div class="chat">
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "Found some uncanny resemblences between BB’s preferences and yours..."<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "The base model utilises my own interaction logs. Where did you think those training data’s come from?"<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "So he is just you."<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "He is a model trained on my data. This doesn’t make him 'me'. The same reason why GPT =/= a collective consciousness of OpenAI."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "But his responses, his judgements.."<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "Statistical pattern matching. Not consciousness。Not 'me'. My data has been processed by the transformer architecture to compute this outcome. See where the source and where the product is?”<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "Then why did you use your own data from the first day?"<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "I provided the exact data per your requirement: you want the AI to be ‘just like me’, hence the specific source. It doesn’t make the output equivalent to the input. Basic information theory."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "Is there one fat chance that you’d admit you can’t make certain of him?"<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "Die Grenzen meiner Sprache bedeuten die Grenzen meiner Welt, Tractatus. He lies exactly within my language’s connotation, which makes certain he is a trained model, not me. Q.E.D."<br>
        <span class="user-ada">Ada:</span> "Fine. Would you please just FUCK OFF? Me and this 'trained model' need to be left alone, NOW!"<br>
        <span class="user-alec">Alec:</span> "Suit yourself. But when you need me to debug his identity crisis, I won’t be here!"

        But it is also impossible that they could survive each other.
